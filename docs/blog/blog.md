## My First Blog Entry

For the past few days I have been working on the first aspect of my project.
So right now the task that I expect to have finished before the start of next week is to be able to send very simple information via bluetooth
from an app on my phone to the flora system and recieve a message back from the flora telling me the message was recieved.
If I get this finished towards the end of the week I can then move on to using the google maps API for the next step of my project.

## My Second Blog Entry

I have completed the task of connecting my app to the flora board via the Bluefruit bluetooth module so I now have back and forth communication. 
I will now begin the task of integrating the google maps API with my app, and also gps location functionality, so that my app can find a person's location
and plan out their routes which the direction system will guide them along.
